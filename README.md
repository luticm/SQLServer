# SQLServer

This is a repository that I intend to share material related to SQL Server.
The content can vary, being T-SQL or PowerShell scripts, documents, presentations or whatever I see fit.

We need to collaborate to be more efficient, learn from each other, and lose the fear in failing, because we can always take good lessons from it.

Repository for "as-is" solutions and tools/scripts that are published here.
